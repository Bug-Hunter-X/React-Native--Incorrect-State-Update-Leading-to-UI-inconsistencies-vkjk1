This React Native code uses a deprecated method for setting state, which can lead to unexpected behavior and performance issues.  The `setState` method is asynchronous and directly modifying `this.state` will not trigger a re-render. 

```javascript
//Incorrect way:
this.state.count = this.state.count + 1;
this.forceUpdate(); // Bad practice, avoid if possible
```
