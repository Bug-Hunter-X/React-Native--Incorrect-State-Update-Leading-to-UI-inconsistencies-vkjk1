The correct way to update state in React Native is by using the `setState` method. React will batch state updates and efficiently re-render the component.

```javascript
//Correct way:
this.setState(prevState => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 }));
```

Using a functional update with `prevState` ensures that the state update is based on the previous state value, preventing race conditions.  Avoiding direct manipulation of `this.state` ensures the UI reflects the correct data.
